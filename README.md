# Science News Segmentation
Science News Segmentation Project with Segment Prediction Model and Web App

## Project Overview
Using PEW Research Center Data, I built a custom consumer segmentation based on the different typs of Science News Consumers. I analyzed and profiled the differences among the segments in order to understand different potential ad or marketing targeting strategies. To simluate how an advertising agecny would target these segments, I built a predictive model using primarily Demographic and Behavioral variables to predict new consumers into one of uncovered segments. 

## Motivation
A very common marketing strategy is to segment the market and identify certain segments of the market that are more or less attractive to a brand trying to motivate certain people to buy or use their product. It is sometimes easy to imagine the different attitudinal and behavioral consumers who are likely to use a certain product, but not as easy to understand how big they are, or to identify them when it comes to building marketing strategies to target them. You can imagine in the science news world, there are people more likely to enjoy and actively follow science in the news, and people who are just averse to news in general. But how do you find and target the more attractive segment (high science news consumer) over the other (non-news follower)? Advertising agencies can identify these people using certain demographic or behavioral attributes, which is what I have tried to simulate in this project.

## Methodology
### The Data
- Data from PEW Research Center

### The Models
Gaussian Mixture Model

Gradient Boost Classifier

### The Analysis
- Built a Database to easily compare and contrast the difference among the segments
- Created charts profiling each of the segments individually

## Results
- Identified 3 science news segements with a silhoutte score of .44
- Built a model with 68% accuarcy in classifying new consumers to a segment
- Built a Web App with fully profiled segments, targeting strategies, and a short questionnaire built in to give real-time predictions.

## Next Steps
- A/B Testing on the different marketing targeting strategies
