    "\n",
    "### The Process\n",
    "- Created a mock-cluster model to generate segment labels to be appended to the dataset\n",
    "- Generated dummy variables to create a database with only binary responses for each column and renamed the columns accordingly for readability and easy analysis\n",
    "- Grouped respondents by their segment label and summed the columns to get the count of respondents within each segment that responded 'yes' to each variable\n",
    "- Divided each segment row by its corresponding segment size to get the percentage of respondents within each segment that responded 'yes' to each variable\n",
    "- Transposed the table for easy sorting and analysis\n",

    "### The Results\n",
    "- A clean, readable table to analyze any segment solution generated by any model, with any number of segments\n",
